# Faculty Feedback System

A secure, per-class-period faculty feedback platform. Students rate the specific
teacher **for each subject/period they actually attend**; teachers only ever see
anonymous, admin-published results for their own sessions; administrators build
forms, track submissions and publish results.

This is an **upgrade of the existing single-file Flask app** — the technology
stack (Flask + Jinja2 + openpyxl + ReportLab) and the original data model are
preserved. It runs on **SQLite locally** (dev + tests) and on
**PostgreSQL / Supabase in production**, and deploys to **Vercel** as a
serverless function — see **[DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md)**. No existing records are
deleted, and the original `assignments` / `feedback` tables and routes still work.

---

## 1. Quick start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py                     # -> http://localhost:5000
```

On the very first run the app:

1. creates/upgrades the SQLite database `feedback.db` (versioned migrations), and
2. imports `III_semester_Student_timetable_detailed_report.xlsx` into the real
   academic structure (branches, timetables, class periods, teachers, students,
   enrollments, per-session eligibility).

> **Deploying to Vercel + Supabase?** Set `DATABASE_URL` to a `postgres://`
> connection string and the app uses PostgreSQL automatically — see
> **[DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md)** for the step-by-step guide.

### Default logins

| Role    | URL              | Identifier             | Password (default)       |
|---------|------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Student | `/`              | Roll number, e.g. `25B11CS015` | `student@123`    |
| Teacher | `/teacher/login` | Employee code, e.g. `6817`     | `teacher@123`    |
| Admin   | `/admin/login`   | `admin@college.edu`            | `admin123`       |

**Change every default password in production.** Students/teachers can change
their own password at `/change-password`; admins can reset any account from
*Teachers* / *Students*.

### Try the sample scenario

Teacher **CHIKKALA LOVA LAKSHMI (emp 6817)** teaches **ADSA (`2501CS10`)** at
period 3 and **ASE (`2501IT07`)** at period 5 in timetable `T1-General`. Create a
form per period and confirm the two sets of results never mix — this is the
core business requirement.

## 2. Configuration (environment variables)

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `SECRET_KEY` | auto-generated & persisted in `instance/secret_key` | Session signing (required in production) |
| `DATABASE_URL` | *(unset)* | **Supabase/PostgreSQL** connection string; when set, Postgres is used instead of SQLite |
| `FEEDBACK_DB` | `./feedback.db` | SQLite database path (used when `DATABASE_URL` is unset) |
| `FEEDBACK_XLSX` | `./III_semester_...xlsx` | Timetable workbook |
| `ADMIN_EMAIL` | `admin@college.edu` | Bootstrap admin login |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | `admin123` | Bootstrap admin password |
| `DEFAULT_TEACHER_PASSWORD` | `teacher@123` | Seeded teacher password |
| `DEFAULT_STUDENT_PASSWORD` | `student@123` | Seeded student password |
| `ACADEMIC_YEAR` | `2025-26` | Academic year label for the import |
| `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` | `0` | Set to `1` behind HTTPS |
| `AUTO_IMPORT` | `1` | Import the workbook when the DB is empty (`0` in production) |
| `LOGIN_MAX_ATTEMPTS` | `8` | Failed logins before lockout |
| `LOGIN_LOCKOUT_SECONDS` | `300` | Lockout duration |

See `.env.example`. A production launch uses a WSGI server, e.g.
`waitress-serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 app:app`.

```

### Database

Two backends are supported transparently:

* **SQLite** (default) — the local file `feedback.db`; used for development and
  the test suite.
* **PostgreSQL / Supabase** — selected automatically when `DATABASE_URL` (or
  `SUPABASE_DB_URL`) is a `postgres://` connection string. The adapter
  `feedback_system/pg.py` keeps the `sqlite3` ergonomics (`?` placeholders, rows
  addressable by index *and* name, `lastrowid` via `RETURNING id`) and rewrites
  the few SQLite-only constructs into PostgreSQL, so no application code is
  duplicated. The generated SQL is validated against the real PostgreSQL grammar
  in the test suite.

Versioned migrations (`feedback_system/schema.py`) applied by `db.run_migrations`:

* **v1** reproduces the *original* `assignments` and `feedback` tables verbatim.
* **v2** adds `timetable`, `period_no`, `semester`, `academic_year` to `assignments`.
* **v3** adds the academic/auth/feedback domain tables.
* **v4** adds `session_students` (the eligible population per teaching session).
* **v5** adds `form_sessions` (the sessions a form is distributed to) plus
  `scope`, `subject_code` and `subject_name` on `feedback_forms`, so a single
  form can cover a subject across **all timetables**. Existing forms are
  back-filled (one `form_sessions` row each) — **no data is dropped**.

Key relationships:

```
branches ──< timetables ──< class_sessions ──< session_students >── users(student)
                │                 │                                     │
        feedback_forms ──< form_sessions >── class_sessions             │
                │                                                      │
                ├──< form_questions ──< question_options               │
                │                                                      │
                └──< submissions (student link, for completion only) ──┘
                          └──< answers   (NO student link  → anonymous)
        result_publications (form+session publish state)
```

`form_sessions` is the **single source of truth for eligibility**: a student is
eligible for a form when one of the form's covered sessions lists them in
`session_students`. The same rule powers the create-form preview, publication,
submission tracking and both PDF reports — so the preview count always equals the
published eligible count.

**Anonymity** is enforced structurally: `answers` link only to `submissions`,
and the `anonymous_answers` view exposes answers with **no** student column.
Every teacher-facing query reads through that view, and no student identifier is
ever selected, rendered, exported or logged for teachers.

## 4. Feature summary

* **Admin auth** – email + password, hashed (scrypt), sessions, logout, CSRF,
  rate-limiting/lockout, RBAC, audit log.
* **Admin dashboard** – stat tiles + **Quick Actions** in the upper-middle area
  (academics, timetables, subjects, teachers, students, form builder, tracking,
  preview/publish, reports, audit, re-import).
* **Form builder with two modes** – a **Normal** mode (Subject + Teacher + Period,
  the original behaviour) and a **Subject only** mode that creates **one** form
  for every eligible student of a subject, optionally across **No Preference (All
  Timetables)**. The builder cascades year → semester → branch → timetable →
  subject and shows a live **eligible-student preview** before publishing.
  Dynamic questions with a **+** button, per-question type (rating / single /
  multiple choice / written), required flags, configurable options (e.g.
  Excellent/Good/Bad/Very poor — editable/extendable), reorder/delete,
  **Save Draft** and **Publish Form** as distinct actions.
* **Subject-scoped forms** – one form distributes to every teaching session of a
  subject in the selected configuration (all timetables, or a single timetable).
  Duplicate forms for the same subject+configuration are blocked; publishing is
  blocked when a subject has **0 eligible students**.
* **Individual class-period feedback** – in Normal mode every form targets one
  teaching session `(academic year, semester, branch, timetable, subject, teacher,
  period)`; answers are bound to that session and can never appear under another
  subject of the same teacher.
* **Student dashboard** – shows only the sessions the student is eligible for,
  with year/semester (Year 1 = Sem 1–2 … Year 4 = Sem 7–8) derived from
  enrollment data; validation, confirmation, pending/submitted statuses,
  duplicate + closed-form protection, answers preserved on recoverable errors.
* **Teacher dashboard** – subject selector (auto-selected when only one subject),
  question-wise counts and percentages over the real valid-response denominator,
  anonymous paginated suggestions, and **published-only** visibility scoped and
  authorised on the backend.
* **Submission tracking** – filters (year, semester, branch, timetable, teacher,
  subject, form status, include archived/deleted), summary stats, **Submitted** /
  **Not Submitted** roll lists, historical timetable snapshots, CSV export.
* **Preview & publish** – separate preview and a distinct *Publish Results*
  action (plus unpublish with audit logging); form status and result publication
  status are independent.
* **Admin PDF reports** – two accurate ReportLab PDFs built from live records:
  **submitted students** and **eligible students who have not submitted**. They
  honour the dashboard/report filters (year, semester, branch, timetable,
  feedback form), never duplicate a student, and contain **completion data only**
  (no answer content), so anonymity is preserved. Available from the dashboard
  *Download PDF reports* card and the Reports page.
* **Clear mode toggle & readable UI** – strong active/inactive styling for the
  Normal/Subject-only toggle, legible dropdown options and disabled controls,
  consistent keyboard focus rings, and improved text contrast.
* **Search / responsive tables** – case-insensitive search, filter+pagination,
  scrollable table containers with sticky headers, empty states.
* **Security** – hashing, RBAC, backend validation, CSRF, SQL-injection safety
  (parameterised queries), XSS-safety (Jinja autoescaping + JS escaping), safe
  error pages, audit logging.

### Routes added / changed by this upgrade

| Method | Route | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/admin/reports/submitted-students.pdf` | PDF of students who submitted (respects filters) |
| GET | `/admin/reports/not-submitted-students.pdf` | PDF of eligible students who have **not** submitted |
| GET | `/admin/api/subjects` | Distinct subjects for the selected year/semester/branch/timetable |
| GET | `/admin/api/subject/preview` | Eligible-session/timetable/student preview + duplicate check |
| POST | `/admin/forms/save` | Now accepts `scope=subject` and creates one form for a subject |

---

## 5. Tests

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m pytest
```

The suite builds a throwaway database (running the real import) and exercises
auth/RBAC, the form builder, the full student→tracking→publish→teacher flow,
per-period isolation, duplicate/closed/ineligible protection, anonymity,
publication gating, history preservation, search and exports. It also covers the
subject-scoped (all-timetable) forms, specific-timetable restriction,
preview == published eligibility, duplicate prevention, per-form tracking, PDF
report auth/content/filters/empties, and the **PostgreSQL translation layer**
(every migration statement plus representative queries are parsed with the real
PostgreSQL grammar via `pglast`).

**Result: 181 passed.**

---

## 6. Known limitations / manual steps

* Default seeded passwords are shared by role and should be rotated
  (`DEFAULT_*_PASSWORD`, per-user reset, or `/change-password`).
* Passwords are not yet forced to change on first login (`must_change_password`
  is set on admin reset but not enforced as a redirect — a small follow-up).
* The app ships with Flask's development server; use a WSGI server in production
  and set `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=1` behind HTTPS.
* Editing a form's questions is intentionally blocked once it has responses
  (409) so historical answers are never orphaned; create a new form instead.
* The legacy `feedback` table is retained for backward compatibility but the new
  form/answer tables are the operational source of truth.

## HOD / Dean / Second-faculty upgrade (v8)

See **[IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md](IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md)** for the full inventory, migration notes, test results, and list of college data still required.

New logins (after Admin creates accounts + department scopes):

| Role | URL | Identifier |
|------|-----|------------|
| HOD  | `/hod/login`  | Employee code |
| Dean | `/dean/login` | Employee code |

Admin tools added:

* `/admin/second-faculty` — mapping status & import batches
* `/admin/accounts/hod-dean` — HOD/Dean accounts + CSV template
* `/admin/requirements` — feedback requirements for Dean publication monitoring

**Important:** `Individual Workload.xlsx` and `CSE_III_Sem_Second_Faculty_Import.xlsx` were not included in the source ZIP. The import workflow is ready; it will not invent assignments.
